# Netlify Deployment Guide

## ✅ **Ready for Netlify Deployment**

The application has been modified to work with Netlify's static hosting by removing the backend dependency.

### **Changes Made:**
1. ✅ **Removed backend API calls** - Now loads CSV files directly from `/public/Phase2/`
2. ✅ **Added client-side CSV parsing** - Handles CSV data parsing in the browser
3. ✅ **Removed proxy configuration** - No longer needs backend server
4. ✅ **Static file loading** - All data loads from public folder

### **Deployment Steps:**

#### **Method 1: Drag & Drop (Easiest)**
1. Run `npm run build` in the `dashboard_local` folder
2. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up/login
3. Drag the `dashboard_local/build` folder to the Netlify dashboard
4. Your site will be deployed automatically!

#### **Method 2: Git Integration**
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
3. Set build settings:
   - **Build command**: `cd dashboard_local && npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `dashboard_local/build`
4. Deploy!

### **File Structure for Netlify:**
```
dashboard_local/
├── build/                    # ← Deploy this folder
├── public/
│   └── Phase2/              # ← CSV files here
│       ├── 01Aug_Phase2_Ammonia.csv
│       └── 05Aug_Phase2_p-Cresol.csv
└── src/
    └── Phase2Dashboard.js   # ← Modified for static loading
```

### **Features Working on Netlify:**
- ✅ **Dynamic file loading** from `/Phase2/` folder
- ✅ **CSV data parsing** in the browser
- ✅ **All analytics and visualizations**
- ✅ **Heater profile-based analytics**
- ✅ **Phase-wise data analysis**
- ✅ **Enhanced CSV viewer with search/filter/pagination**
- ✅ **Performance optimizations**

### **No Backend Required!**
The application now works completely as a static site, making it perfect for Netlify deployment.

### **Testing Locally:**
```bash
cd dashboard_local
npm start
```
Visit `http://localhost:3000` - should work without backend server!
